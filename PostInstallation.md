# Post Installation

Once you have logged in, you'll probably wanna do these things:

## Install applications

Start by opening the terminal (not as root) and running 

`polo-pkg update`

to synchronize all your packages. Now you can run

`polo-pkg install steam`

to install Steam.

## Add pretty name to users

Open up the Budgie Control Center and go to the Users section.

Now unlock the settings and press the pencil. Now type in a new name.

Congratulations! You have finished installing Polaris Linux with the whole guide.

Optionally if you wanna get a screenshot to showoff to your friends run

`about-polaris` to get the system stats.
